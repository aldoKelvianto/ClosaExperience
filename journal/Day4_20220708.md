- In XCode, you can only find the callers of a function. You can't find the callers of a class, struct or a variable 😓. You can search class or variable usages through "Find navigator" (Text search). But I'd expect more functionality for a full-blown IDE that enforces it's user to use GUI. Even SublimeText has that feature.

- XCode don't have terminal navigator.

- Just like Java, there is no built-in support for singleton in Swift. In Kotlin, we have `object`. To create a singleton, you can use:

1. global variable
2. static on class or struct

This begs a question, which one we should use? Use class for mutable singleton and struct for immutable singleton. Although you can make struct as an mutable singleton by declaring your field as `var` instead of `let`. But as a convention, struct is for immutable singleton.

```swift
struct PersistenceController {
	static let shared = PersistenceController()
}

struct WeatheringWithSwiftApp: App {
	let controller = PersistenceController.shared
}
```

- SF symbols is very useful for making an app pretty without having to prepare visual assets.
