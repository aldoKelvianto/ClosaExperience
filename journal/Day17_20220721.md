UIViewController Lifecycle

The nouns for view are:
- load
- appear
- dissapear
- layout subviews


```swift
class MyViewController: UIViewController {

	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()
		// When content view created in memory
		// IBOutlet Views are guaranteed to be loaded
	}

	override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
		super.viewWillAppear(animated)
		// Before content view is 
		// added to app's view hierarchy
	}

	override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
		super.viewDidAppear(animated)
		// Called after the content view is added
		// to app's view hierarchy
	}

	override func viewWillDissapear(_ animated: Bool) {
		super.viewWillDissapear(animated)
		// Called before the content view is
		// removed from the view hierarchy
	}

	override func viewDidDissapear(_ animated: Bool) {
		super.viewDidDissapear(animated)
		// Called after the content view is removed
		// from the view hierarchy
	}

	override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() { 
		// Called when the content's view bounds change
		// but BEFORE it lays out its subview
		// Like rotating your phone
	}

	override func viewDidLayoutSubviews() { 
		// Called when the content's view bounds change
		// AFTER it lays out its subview
	}
}
```

- A view may has been added to view hierarchy but not "appear". For example `view.isHidden = true`. Or when another view is overlapping the current view.

- Let's say you have two VC, list VC and detail VC. If you go to list VC to detail VC and list VC again, the list VC's did load won't called twice. But the list VC's will appear is called twice.

```swift
let detailVC = DetailVC(detail: String)
navigationController?.pushViewController(detailVC, animated: true)
```

- viewWillAppear use case: reset a state after returning back from another a screen. Like resetting a text field `usernameTextField.text = ""`.

- viewWillAppear use case: initiate the view. I.e setting the navigation bar. (navigation bar = Toolbar in Android)


```swift
navigationController?.setNavigationBarHidden(true, animated: true)
```

- viewDidAppear use case: Starting an animation. You want to start the animation after the view is already appeared. Not too soon.

- viewWillDissapear use case: Save a state before user leave this view.

Application Lifecycle

Typical scenario:
- Not Running -> Foreground Inactive -> Foreground Active
- Background -> Suspended -> Not running
- Suspended -> Background -> Foreground Inactive -> Foreground Active

Background scheduler scenario:
Not running -> Background

When application change it's state, we can receive a callback.

Launch

- willFinishLaunchingWithOptions
- didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
- sceneWillEnterForeground
- sceneDidBecomeActive

Termination

- sceneWillResignActive
- sceneDidEnterBackground
- applicationWillTerminate
