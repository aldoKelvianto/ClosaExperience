A provisioning profiles
Apple’s definition: A provisioning profile is a collection of digital entities that uniquely ties developers and devices to an authorized iPhone Development Team and enables a device to be used for testing.

Unlike Android, in iOS we can’t install app outside of the App store. But, what about app that we're developed?

Using provisoning profile, we can choose which iPhone can run your app along with it's capabilities.

You can download provisoning profile from your developer account and embed the profile to your app. Then, the app is code-signed. For development, we can use development provisioning profile.

What's inside provisioning profile?
1. Unique device identifiers (iPhone that your app can run)
2. App ID
3. Development certificate

One iPhone can have multiple provisioning profiles.

Development profile is for development, that's why it contains a unique device ids. Distribution profile does not contain device id, because the app can be installed on any device.

What exactly is provisioning profile?
It's a profile file that contains property list.
Think of binary version of an XML/key-value pairs.
